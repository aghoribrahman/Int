Python Projects  
 
Smart Alcohol Detection System GPS & GSM Based  
 
This system is aimed at making vehicle driving safer than before. This is implemented 
using Python and Micro Controller , the detection of alc ohol using alcohol detector 
connected to Arduino such that when the level of alcohol crosses a permissible limit, the vehicle ignition system will turn off and the GPS module will capture the present 
location of the vehicle  
 
Automatic Street light intensit y controller  
 
A simple & powerful concept, which uses transistor (light Dependent diode) as switch 
to switch ON & off the street light automatically, By using this manual works are 
removed. It automatically switch off  & on with respect to illuminate of sunlight.  
 
Python Face Detection  
  
Face Detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a 
cascade function is trained with a set of input Data. Open CV already contains many 
pre trained classifiers Data for face, eyes, smiles etc.
